    Binary tree is a tree where every 
    node has at most two children per node
    (could have less though)
    -exactly one root (topmost node)
    - exactly 1 path between root and any node
    - ex. connects A-E with only one path
    - ex. connects A-F with only one path


    -empty tree (zero nodes) can be a binary tree

    -initialize object
    - left and right pointers to children
    -leaves with no children - node.null
